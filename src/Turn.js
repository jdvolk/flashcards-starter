/*
Your Turn class should meet the following requirements:

Instantiated with two arguments - a string 
  (that represents a user’s guess to the question), 
  and a Card object for the current card in play.

returnGuess: method that returns the guess

returnCard: method that returns the Card

evaluateGuess: method that returns a boolean indicating 
  if the user’s guess matches the correct answer on the card

giveFeedback - method that returns either 
  ‘incorrect!’ or ‘correct!’ based on whether 
  the guess is correct or not.
*/
